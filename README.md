# -IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Summary of the Solution:

The task involves training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements. The measurements include features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We have been given information that the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, which can be used for this task.

The solution provided in the code involves the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries: The code begins by importing libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.

Loading the dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing: The 'Id' column is removed as it is not relevant to the analysis. The dataset is then split into features (X) and labels (y).

Model Creation and Training:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model: A KNN classifier with one neighbor is created and trained on the training data.
Decision Tree Model: A Decision Tree classifier is created and trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of both KNN and Decision Tree models is evaluated on both the training and test datasets. The accuracy represents how well the models can classify the iris flowers.

New Predictions: The models are used to make predictions on new input samples with iris measurements.

Data Visualization: Data visualization is performed using a pairplot to visualize the relationships between features, and a bar chart compares the training and test accuracies of the models.

Conclusion: A summary is provided in the code comments, stating that both KNN and Decision Tree models were trained and evaluated. It mentions the achieved accuracy and the successful predictions for new input samples. The importance of data visualization in assessing model performance is also highlighted.

In summary, the solution involves the preparation of the Iris dataset, training of two different machine learning models, model evaluation, data visualization for insights, and a concluding statement about the model's performance. This solution provides a practical example of how to approach a classification problem using machine learning techniques with the Iris dataset.
